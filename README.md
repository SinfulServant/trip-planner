# TripPlanner

This project was created as test task for Reenbit Trainee Camp: Fullstack Development. 

## Technologies 
For creating this app I have used:
1. Angular
2. Visual crossing weather API — for getting weather info
3. Unsplash API — for generation photos of cities.

## App on GitHub pages — https://sinfulservant.github.io/trip-planner/

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
